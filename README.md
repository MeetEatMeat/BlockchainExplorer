# How to launch script

* Install dependencies:

Run in console:

````
npm i
````
* Run script:
````
npm start src/scripts/csv2csv.ts
````
# Check files
Go to src/data and check coinbase.csv file and then go to exports directory, and check all export files.
There is a file that was altered, some addresses was replaced with addresses of Coinbase took from coinbase.csv

That was made in demonstration purpose, to prove that script works. You can replace all files from exports directory with files made up with actual transactions of Coinbase downloaded from [etherscan](etherscan.io)
